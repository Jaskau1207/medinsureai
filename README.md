# medinsureai
A flask-based health and insurance web app that developed as a part of my 6 weeks training (June'25 - July'25). It uses Python, Machine Learning and Flask to predict health insurance cost, health risks such as diabetes, hypertension and health score based on their lifestyle choices a, implementing everything I learnt during the training period.
